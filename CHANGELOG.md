# Changelog

All notable player-facing changes to **Pandora Saga Simulator Remaked** are recorded here.

## 2026.09.2 — Search and local builds

### Added
- **Equipment Search** over the item options already considered compatible by the legacy simulator, with name and level filters.
- **Soul Search** for the Soul sockets and options currently exposed by the legacy simulator.
- Automatic local autosave with compatible-session recovery after refresh.
- **Build Manager** for saving, loading, renaming, duplicating and deleting multiple named builds.
- Import and export of the exact legacy serialized build code, without requiring a backend or account.
- Desktop and 390px mobile visual QA captures for the main Modern shell, Equipment Search and Build Manager.

### Reliability
- Added browser contracts for the legacy adapter, search behavior, local storage, autosave recovery, named-build CRUD and import/export.
- Feature and production CI now run the complete shipped Phase-2 browser suite before visual QA or Pages deployment.
- Legacy calculation files remain protected by preservation fingerprints and are not modified by these Modern features.

### Local data
- Autosave and named builds stay in this browser's `localStorage` in this phase.
- Remaked storage uses separate keys and does not replace or delete the legacy simulator's `localStorage.file` value.
- There are no cloud accounts, server-side build storage or cross-device sync in this release.
